ister v3

ister is a template based installer for linux

See the ister-design for information regarding how ister will work and what the
template format supported is.

Currently ister is in heavy development and is missing most features.

Ister aims to be pylint and pep8 clean. New code should verify both pass without
exception before being submitted. If a new exception makes sense it can be added
on a case by case basis.

Testing is supported through the run-tests.sh script, it requires an image source
in a format qemu-nbd can handle. It will attempt to detect nbd support in the
kernel and load it if it isn't already active. The script also uses partprobe,
qemu-img, and qemu-nbd to setup a VM to run the tests in. After the VM exists,
the test results are shown and the system is restored to its previous state.
